## Routing Documentation ([JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com))

Allows to define structured routes and associated handlers.

### Description

Routing is a feature that is installed into an Application to simplify and structure page request handling. This page
explains the routing feature. Extracting information about a request, and generating valid responses inside a route, is
described on the requests and responses pages.

```application.install(Routing) {
    get("/") {
        call.respondText("Hello, World!")
    }
    get("/bye") {
        call.respondText("Good bye, World!")
    }

```

`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `head` and `options` functions are convenience shortcuts to a flexible and powerful
routing system. In particular, get is an alias to `route(HttpMethod.Get, path) { handle(body) }`, where body is a lambda
passed to the get function.

### Usage

## Routing Tree

Routing is organized in a tree with a recursive matching system that is capable of handling quite complex rules for
request processing. The Tree is built with nodes and selectors. The Node contains handlers and interceptors, and the
selector is attached to an arc which connects another node. If selector matches current routing evaluation context, the
algorithm goes down to the node associated with that selector.

Routing is built using a DSL in a nested manner:

```kotlin
route("a") { // matches first segment with the value "a"
  route("b") { // matches second segment with the value "b"
     get {…} // matches GET verb, and installs a handler
     post {…} // matches POST verb, and installs a handler
  }
}
```

```kotlin
method(HttpMethod.Get) { // matches GET verb
   route("a") { // matches first segment with the value "a"
      route("b") { // matches second segment with the value "b"
         handle { … } // installs handler
      }
   }
}
```kotlin
route resolution algorithms go through nodes recursively discarding subtrees where selector didn't match.

Builder functions:
* `route(path)` – adds path segments matcher(s), see below about paths
* `method(verb)` – adds HTTP method matcher.
* `param(name, value)` – adds matcher for a specific value of the query parameter
* `param(name)` – adds matcher that checks for the existence of a query parameter and captures its value
* `optionalParam(name)` – adds matcher that captures the value of a query parameter if it exists
* `header(name, value)` – adds matcher that for a specific value of HTTP header, see below about quality

## Path
Building routing tree by hand would be very inconvenient. Thus there is `route` function that covers most of the use cases in a simple way, using path.

`route` function (and respective HTTP verb aliases) receives a `path` as a parameter which is processed to build routing tree. First, it is split into path segments by the `/` delimiter. Each segment generates a nested routing node.

These two variants are equivalent:

```kotlin
route("/foo/bar") { … } // (1)

route("/foo") {
   route("bar") { … } // (2)
}
```

### Parameters

Path can also contain parameters that match specific path segment and capture its value into `parameters` properties of
an application call:

```kotlin
get("/user/{login}") {
   val login = call.parameters["login"]
}
```

When user agent requests `/user/john` using `GET` method, this route is matched and `parameters` property will
have `"login"` key with value `"john"`.

### Optional, Wildcard, Tailcard

Parameters and path segments can be optional or capture entire remainder of URI.

* `{param?}` –- optional path segment, if it exists it's captured in the parameter
* `*` –- wildcard, any segment will match, but shouldn't be missing
* `{...}` –- tailcard, matches all the rest of the URI, should be last. Can be empty.
* `{param...}` –- captured tailcard, matches all the rest of the URI and puts multiple values for each path segment
  into `parameters` using `param` as key. Use `call.parameters.getAll("param")` to get all values.

Examples:

```kotlin
get("/user/{login}/{fullname?}") { … }
get("/resources/{path...}") { … }
```

## Quality

It is not unlikely that several routes can match to the same HTTP request.

One example is matching on the `Accept` HTTP header which can have multiple values with specified priority (quality).

```kotlin
accept(ContentType.Text.Plain) { … }
accept(ContentType.Text.Html) { … }
```

The routing matching algorithm not only checks if a particular HTTP request matches a specific path in a routing tree,
but it also calculates the quality of the match and selects the routing node with the best quality. Given the routes
above, which match on the Accept header, and given the request header `Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html` will
match `text/html` because the quality factor in the HTTP header indicates a lower quality fortext/plain (default is 1.0)
.

The Header `Accept: text/plain, text/*` will match `text/plain`. Wildcard matches are considered less specific than
direct matches. Therefore the routing matching algorithm will consider them to have a lower quality.

Another example is making short URLs to named entities, e.g. users, and still being able to prefer specific pages
like `"settings"`. An example would be

* `https://twitter.com/kotlin` -– displays user `"kotlin"`
* `https://twitter.com/settings` -- displays settings page

This can be implemented like this:

```kotlin
get("/{user}") { … }
get("/settings") { … }
```

The parameter is considered to have a lower quality than a constant string, so that even if `/settings` matches both,
the second route will be selected.

## Authentication Documentation ([JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com))

Handle Basic and Digest HTTP Auth, Form authentication and OAuth 1a and 2

### Description

Ktor supports authentication out of the box as a standard pluggable feature. It supports mechanisms to read credentials,
and to authenticate principals. It can be used in some cases along with the sessions feature to keep the login
information between requests.

### Usage

## Basic usage

Ktor defines two concepts: credentials and principals. A principal is something that can be authenticated: a user, a
computer, a group, etc. A credential is an object that represents a set of properties for the server to authenticate a
principal: a `user/password`, an API key or an authenticated payload signature, etc. To install it, you have to call
to `application.install(Authentication)`. You have to install this feature directly to the application and it won't work
in another `ApplicationCallPipeline` like `Route`. You might still be able to call the install code inside a Route if
you have the `Application` injected in a nested DSL, but it will be applied to the application itself. Using its DSL, it
allows you to configure the authentication providers available:

```kotlin
install(Authentication) {
    basic(name = "myauth1") {
        realm = "Ktor Server"
        validate { credentials ->
            if (credentials.name == credentials.password) {
                UserIdPrincipal(credentials.name)
            } else {
                null
            }
        }
    }
}

```

After defining one or more authentication providers (named or unnamed), with the routing feature you can create a route
group, that will apply that authentication to all the routes defined in that group:

```kotlin
routing {
    authenticate("myauth1") {
        get("/authenticated/route1") {
            // ...
        }
        get("/other/route2") {
            // ...
        }
    }
    get("/") {
        // ...
    }
}

```

You can specify several names to apply several authentication providers, or none or null to use the unnamed one. You can
get the generated Principal instance inside your handler with:

```kotlin
val principal: UserIdPrincipal? = call.authentication.principal<UserIdPrincipal>()

```

In the generic, you have to put a specific type that must match the generated Principal. It will return null in the case
you provide another type. The handler won't be executed if the configured authentication fails (when returning null in
the authentication mechanism)

## Naming the AuthenticationProvider

It is possible to give arbitrary names to the authentication providers you specify, or to not provide a name at all (
unnamed provider) by not setting the name argument or passing a null. You cannot repeat authentication provider names,
and you can define just one provider without a name. In the case you repeat a name for the provider or try to define two
unnamed providers, an exception will be thrown:

```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Provider with the name `authName` is already registered
```

Summarizing:

```kotlin
install(Authentication) {
    basic { // Unamed `basic` provider
        // ...
    }
    form { // Unamed `form` provider (exception, already defined a provider with name = null)
        // ...
    }
    basic("name1") { // "name1" provider
        // ...
    }
    basic("name1") { // "name1" provider (exception, already defined a provider with name = "name1")
        // ...
    }
}

```

## Skipping/Omitting Authentication providers

You can also skip an authentication based on a criteria.

```kotlin
/**
 * Authentication filters specifying if authentication is required for particular [ApplicationCall]
 * If there is no filters, authentication is required. If any filter returns true, authentication is not required.
 */
fun AuthenticationProvider.skipWhen(predicate: (ApplicationCall) -> Boolean)

```

For example, to skip a basic authentication if there is already a session, you could write:

```kotlin
authentication {
    basic {
        skipWhen { call -> call.sessions.get<UserSession>() != null }
    }
}

```

## Authentication Basic Documentation ([JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com))

Handle Basic authentication

### Description

Ktor supports two methods of authentication with the user and raw password as credentials: `basic` and `form`.

### Usage

```kotlin
install(Authentication) {
    basic(name = "myauth1") {
        realm = "Ktor Server"
        validate { credentials -> /*...*/ }
    }

    form(name = "myauth2") {
        userParamName = "user"
        passwordParamName = "password"
        challenge = FormAuthChallenge.Unauthorized
        validate { credentials -> /*...*/ }
    }
}

```

Both authentication providers have a method `validate` to provide a callback that must generate a Principal from given
a `UserPasswordCredential` or null for invalid credentials. That callback is marked as suspending, so that you can
validate credentials in an asynchronous fashion.

### Options

* basic
* form()

## WebSockets Documentation ([JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com))

Adds WebSockets support for bidirectional communication with the client

### Description

This feature adds WebSockets support to Ktor. WebSockets are a mechanism to keep a bi-directional real-time ordered
connection between the server and the client. Each message from this channel is called Frame: a frame can be a text or
binary message, or a close or ping/pong message. Frames can be marked as incomplete or final.

### Usage

## Installation

In order to use the `WebSockets` functionality you first have to install it:

```kotlin
install(WebSockets)
```

You can adjust a few parameters when installing if required:

```kotlin
install(WebSockets) {
    pingPeriod = Duration.ofSeconds(60) // Disabled (null) by default
    timeout = Duration.ofSeconds(15)
    maxFrameSize = Long.MAX_VALUE // Disabled (max value). The connection will be closed if surpassed this length.
    masking = false
}
```

## Basic usage

Once installed, you can define the `webSocket` routes for the `routing` feature:

Instead of the short-lived normal route handlers, webSocket handlers are meant to be long-lived. And all the relevant
WebSocket methods are suspended so that the function will be suspended in a non-blocking way while receiving or sending
messages.

`webSocket` methods receive a callback with a `WebSocketSession` instance as the receiver. That interface defines
an `incoming` (`ReceiveChannel`) property and an `outgoing` (`SendChannel`) property, as well as a close method.

### Usage as an suspend actor

```kotlin
routing {
    webSocket("/") { // websocketSession
        for (frame in incoming) {
            when (frame) {
                is Frame.Text -> {
                    val text = frame.readText()
                    outgoing.send(Frame.Text("YOU SAID: $text"))
                    if (text.equals("bye", ignoreCase = true)) {
                        close(CloseReason(CloseReason.Codes.NORMAL, "Client said BYE"))
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage as a Channel

Since the `incoming` property is a `ReceiveChannel`, you can use it with its stream-like interface:

```kotlin
routing {
    webSocket("/") { // websocketSession
        for (frame in incoming.mapNotNull { it as? Frame.Text }) {
            val text = frame.readText()
            outgoing.send(Frame.Text("YOU SAID $text"))
            if (text.equals("bye", ignoreCase = true)) {
                close(CloseReason(CloseReason.Codes.NORMAL, "Client said BYE"))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Options

* `pingPeriod` -- duration between pings or null to disable pings.
* `timeout` -- write/ping timeout after that a connection will be closed
* `maxFrameSize` -- maximum frame that could be received or sent
* `masking` -- whether masking need to be enabled (useful for security)()

## CallLogging Documentation ([JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com))

Logs client requests

### Description

You might want to log client requests: and the Call Logging feature does just that. It uses
the `ApplicationEnvironment.log(LoggerFactory.getLogger("Application"))` that uses `slf4j` so you can easily configure
the output. For more information on logging in Ktor, please check the logging in the ktor page.

### Usage

## Basic usage

The basic unconfigured feature logs every request using the level `TRACE`:

```kotlin
install(CallLogging)

```

## Configuring

This feature allows you to configure the log level and filtering the requests that are being logged:

```kotlin
install(CallLogging) {
    level = Level.INFO
    filter { call -> call.request.path().startsWith("/section1") }
    filter { call -> call.request.path().startsWith("/section2") }
    // ...
}

```

The filter method keeps an allow list of filters. If no filters are defined, everything is logged. And if there are
filters, if any of them returns true, the call will be logged.

In the example, it will log both: `/section1/*` and `/section2/*` requests.

## MDC

The `CallLogging` feature supports `MDC` (Mapped Diagnostic Context) from `slf4j` to associate information as part of
the request.

When installing the `CallLogging`, you can configure a parameter to associate to the request with the mdc method. This
method requires a key name, and a function provider. The context would be associated (and the providers will be called)
as part of the `Monitoring` pipeline phase.

```kotlin
install(CallLogging) {
    mdc(name) { // call: ApplicationCall ->
        "value"
    }
    // ...
}

```
